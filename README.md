This Password Manager Program Will Let You Relax As Now All You Have To Remember Is Hydrogen (Master ID And Password) To Access And Manage
 All Your Credentials In Secure Way.

 (ie. now i can store facebook Gmail twitter and many more account credentials at one place to avoid forgetting it.)

Features : 

1. Strong Symmetric Based Encryption For :
    a. Master Account ie. (Password Manager Main Credentials)

    		It is required to access the main vault which holds all the credentials.

    b. For Credentials Of every Saved Account Under Vault.

    	I Know Your Privacy Is Important, Hence In Hydrogen Your Every Credential Will Be Stored In Encrypted Database.

3. Any Bugs / Absence Of Feature In This Version (Soon To Be Fixed In Next Version)
  
   1. Recovery Of Master Password Is Not Supported Till Now.
   2. Code Is Currently Not Quite UserFriendly.
